# Workout-Tracker
For this assignment, I was to create a workout tracker. This assignment will require a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.



## Application Requirements
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:


* Add exercises to a previous workout plan.


* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.


* View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.




## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
